#twine

##overview
twine is an [asynchronous](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) [inversion of control](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) container for javascript.  twine achieves dependency injection via [object composition](https://github.com/kriszyp/compose) - ie mixins applied before construction.

##influences
although i've never actually used any of these libraries, the design of twine was influenced by [Castle Windsor](http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx), [Cairngorm 3](http://sourceforge.net/adobe/cairngorm/wiki/CairngormLibraries/) and [Parsley](http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/).  those frameworks should be commended for their clear and comprehensive documentation.
